# 🎶 Song of Humanity

**"Song of Humanity"** is an AI-powered web experience that transforms human emotions into beautiful poetic songs — giving voice to feelings through the art of lyrical storytelling.

## 🌟 Project Overview

In a world where emotions are often left unspoken, *Song of Humanity* bridges that gap. It allows users to enter any emotion, and instantly receive a musical, poetic reflection in return — as if the soul is singing its story.

This project was created for the **CS Girlies Hackathon 2025**, with the goal of blending **AI, empathy, and expression**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (deployed locally and linked with backend)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo (Chat Completions API)
- **Hosting**: Backend running live on Replit

## ✨ Features

- 🌈 Enter any human emotion (e.g., "grief", "hope", "confusion")
- 🎤 Receive poetic, lyrical verses generated via AI
- 🎼 Structured like a real song — verses, chorus, bridge
- 🔄 Fallback poetry if API key is missing or rate-limited
- 🔐 API key and project ID are **securely removed** for open-source safety

## 📡 Live Backend Demo

> ⚠️ **Note**: For security, the OpenAI API key and project ID are not publicly included. However, a poetic fallback mechanism is active, ensuring uninterrupted demos.

## 🔒 Security & Deployment Note

- API key and project metadata have been **intentionally excluded** from the codebase before uploading to GitHub.
- The app runs in **Replit live environment** and demonstrates full backend functionality.
- Since platforms like Netlify are for frontend hosting, and backend platforms like Heroku/Railway required paid upgrades, we opted for a **free, secure, working backend link** via Replit for judging purposes.
